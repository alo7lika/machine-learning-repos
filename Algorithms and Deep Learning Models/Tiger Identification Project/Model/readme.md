## Model Architectures
The following deep learning architectures were implemented and evaluated for the tiger Re-ID task:

1) DenseNet: Known for its dense connections between layers, which enhance feature propagation and reduce vanishing gradients.
2) VGG16: A deep convolutional neural network with 16 layers, known for its simplicity and effectiveness in image classification tasks.
3) ResNet50: A 50-layer deep network utilizing residual connections to facilitate training of deeper networks by addressing the vanishing gradient problem.
4) EfficientNet: A family of models that scale up both the depth and width of networks while balancing the input resolution, providing state-of-the-art performance with fewer parameters.
