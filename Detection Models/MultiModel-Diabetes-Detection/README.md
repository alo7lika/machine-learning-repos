## Overview

This project aims to develop a diabetes detection system using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset. It leverages three ensemble models: Stacking, Soft Voting, and Hard-Soft Voting to improve the accuracy and reliability of predictions.

## Use Case

The implemented feature enhances the project by:
- Improving predictive accuracy for diabetes detection.
- Providing more reliable and robust predictions.
- Facilitating better decision-making in healthcare applications.

## Benefits

The benefits of this feature include:
- Enhanced model robustness through ensemble learning.
- Increased reliability in diabetes detection.
- Contribution to improved patient outcomes in healthcare applications.
- A valuable resource for the data science and machine learning community.

## Dataset

The project utilizes the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset from Kaggle. Below are the paths to the dataset files:

- `kaggle/input/pima-indians-diabetes-database/diabetes.csv`
- `kaggle/input/pimaindiansdiabetesdata/pima-indians-diabetes.data.csv`
- `kaggle/input/diabetes-data-set/diabetes.csv`
- `kaggle/input/pima-diabetes/pimaindians-diabetes.data.csv`
- `kaggle/input/pimaindiansdiabetescsv/pima-indians-diabetes.csv`

## Models Used

1. **Stacking Model:** Combines multiple classifiers with a meta-learner for final predictions.
2. **Soft Voting Model:** Averages the predicted probabilities from different models.
3. **Hard-Soft Voting Model:** Integrates both hard voting (majority class) and soft voting (probability-based).

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter notebook provided in this project.
2. Load the dataset.
3. Preprocess the data as needed.
4. Train the ensemble models.
5. Evaluate the model performance.

## Model Performance Metrics

The models are evaluated using the following metrics:
- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score

## Future Work

- Explore additional features for better model performance.
- Implement more advanced ensemble techniques.
- Conduct a comparative analysis with other machine learning algorithms.
